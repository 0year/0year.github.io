<p>Why compact set is so useful?</p>
<p>Define: say a set is compact (in metric space X),if any open cover of K can find a finite subcover</p>
<p>to draw a set A is not compact is simple if you can give an open cover that cannot find a finite subcover,like a collection cannot remove some of the open set</bar>
<p>the key is how to proof a set is compact--in some degree ,you should see about any case</p>

<p>compact sets may be the next better sets than the finite sets,because they both have good properties in common:</p>
 <p>1.finite sets are compact</p>   
    
    <p>2.finite sets are bounded ,so the same as compact sets(we can just choose one finite subcover and find the side[a set A is bounded means there exists a point x, with a number r,every s in A satisfies d(x,s)&lt;r])</p>
<p>3.the three properties are equal.(1)a set is closed and bounded(2)a set is compact(3)every infinite subset of E has at least one limit point in E</p>
